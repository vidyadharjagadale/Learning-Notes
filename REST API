Put vs PATCH.

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript/difference-between-put-and-patch-request/

HTTP PUT request is used to replace and update the entire resource or
document, while the PATCH request only updates the specific parts of that
document.
When working with APIs, figuring out the right way to update resources
can be tricky. Both PUT and PATCH requests are used for this purpose.
This guide will break down the key differences between these two
methods, helping you choose the most appropriate approach for your
needs.

When deciding between PUT and PATCH, consider whether you need to update the entire resource or just part of it. 
Use PUT when you want to completely replace a resource, and use PATCH when you only need to make small updates.
